            <h2>MAKOKO DREAM FOUNDATION</h2>
            <p>The Makoko Dream School is a tuition-free education program serving students who live in 
                waterfront areas. The school is funded through a Parent/Teacher Association levy and has 
                served roughly 1,000 children so far. The Makoko Dream School is a school on water, one of 
                the few schools on water in Makoko – but the only school where the children learn basic 
                English Language, Arithmetics and Communication in both their native and a foreign language. 
                The Makoko Dream School Project aims to inspire more children to be in school and learn 
                relevant skills so that illiteracy will be reduced in Makoko. 
            </p>
            <p>Makoko waterside is well known for being a huge community of people vastly neglected by the
                seeming developed society surrounding it. The first set of people to settle there were the 
                Egun people from Badagry; fishermen who survived and thrived on the swamp.The Makoko Dream 
                is an initiative founded by Emmanuel Agunze that aims to make a Makoko child dare to dream 
                to be great and not be reduced to the confines of his/her environment. With this in mind, 
                The Makoko dream have discovered a way to reduce child labour is by education, and so they 
                have started The Makoko Dream School powered by The Aliyu Foundation project.</p>

                There is also a demand for educational materials such as exercise books, textbooks, pencils, 
                and pens to aid in the learning process. Basic snacks for children, wears 
                essential for students to participate fully in academic and extracurricular activities. 
                Additionally, foldable plastic chairs and tables would significantly improve the quality 
                of schooling by providing more comfortable seating arrangements. First aid boxes are 
                necessary to ensure health and safety.

            <p> A leading non-profit organization committed to improving the lives of individuals with 
                Down syndrome in Nigeria. Established in 2001, DSFN was founded in response to the lack of 
                awareness, support, and resources available for individuals with Down syndrome and their 
                families. Since its inception, the foundation has been a beacon of hope, working to ensure 
                that people with Down syndrome have access to the education, healthcare, and social inclusion 
                they need to live fulfilling lives.
            </p>

            <p>
                Education is one of the most critical areas of focus for DSFN. Individuals with Down syndrome 
                often have learning difficulties that require specialized education tailored to their needs. 
                DSFN provides a range of educational programs that cater to the developmental and intellectual 
                challenges faced by children with Down syndrome. These programs are designed to help children 
                develop cognitive skills, motor skills, communication abilities, and social interaction skills. 
                In addition to academic education, the foundation offers *vocational training programs* for young 
                adults with Down syndrome. These programs aim to equip them with practical skills that can help them 
                gain employment or engage in entrepreneurship, thereby promoting independence and self-reliance.
